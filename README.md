# KalmanFilter

Updated implementation of https://github.com/wearereasonablepeople/KalmanFilter with asserts and indexOutOfBounds runtime exceptions replaced by Swift's error handling. The resulting code is not as pretty. In fact all the `try`'s and `throws` everywhere almost lead me to abandon the effort. However I chose to continue to hopefully prevent runtime crashes due to unexpected input.
